# Desk Mount

This is a bespoke desk mount for Jenny's desk.  The top and bottom pieces are joined with inexpensive .25" music wire from HD.

## Bottom

this bolts the the bottom of the desk with minimal intrusion.  the cutout is straddling the metal desk frame.

## Top / Shelf

I made an effort here to stay clear of the fans and vents of the laptop.
